notes:
- MVC -- model, view and controller design (each in different classes)
- a step() method 'ticks' the game across all objects (redraw the room, etc.)
- game model knows everything about the game

- change images to simple space themed
- make waves go faster and more intense
- use pack
- laser towers
- flame thrower towers
- faster enemies
- bulkier enemies
- damaging enemies -- repair by tapping towers
